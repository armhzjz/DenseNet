## About <a name = "about"></a>

After reading the [DenseNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993) I was very surprised for it being so simple and yet so powerfull. So I decided to make my own implementation of it and give it a try.<br>
I used [this Cifar-10 datase](https://www.kaggle.com/emadtolba/cifar10-comp) from kaggle to test the performance of my implementation. For that purpose, I trained a total of 4 DenseNet networks to the data; 2 of them were BC variants and the other to were none BC networks. The quick analysis I did on these four networks can be found in [this jupyter notebook](performance_Analysis/Cifar-10_performanceTest.ipynb).

While implementing my DenseNet solution I stumble upon [this other DenseNet](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100) implementation from [@weiaicunzai](https://github.com/weiaicunzai). Even though my implmentation was almost finish (and very alike I must admit), it was useful to have another reference apart from the paper.
